The Inventory Management System is a full-stack web application designed to efficiently handle inventory tracking, order processing, and consumer management for businesses of any scale. It is developed with the goal of providing a user-friendly, intuitive, and highly interactive platform that simplifies managing day-to-day operations related to products, consumers, and orders.

The frontend of the system is powered by React.js, which ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface. The visual components are styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly design, while PrimeReact is used to provide rich UI elements like tables, forms, and dialogs. To enhance the user experience, Sonner provides smooth notifications and UI feedback. Data management within the frontend is handled by React Redux, allowing for centralized state management across the application. React Router Dom enables seamless navigation between different sections of the application, while Axios is used to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend. Formik and Yup are employed to validate user input, ensuring data integrity across forms.
On the backend, the application is powered by Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js. MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based NoSQL database, is used for managing and storing the data related to products, consumers, and orders. bcryptjs ensures that user passwords are securely hashed, while jsonwebtoken (JWT) provides secure user authentication, maintaining session validity for 24 hours. dotenv is used for environment variable management, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend.
The system features five core modules:
